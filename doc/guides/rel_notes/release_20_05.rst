     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:

     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)

     =========================================================

* **Added Trace Library and Tracepoints**

  A native implementation of ``common trace format(CTF)`` based trace library
  has been added to provide the ability to add tracepoints in
  application/library to get runtime trace/debug information for control and
  fast APIs with minimum impact on fast path performance.
  Typical trace overhead is ~20 cycles and instrumentation overhead is 1 cycle.
  Added tracepoints in ``EAL``, ``ethdev``, ``cryptodev``, ``eventdev`` and
  ``mempool`` libraries for important functions.

* **Added new API for rte_ring.**

  * New synchronization modes for rte_ring.

  Introduced new optional MT synchronization modes for rte_ring:
  Relaxed Tail Sync (RTS) mode and Head/Tail Sync (HTS) mode.
  With these mode selected, rte_ring shows significant improvements for
  average enqueue/dequeue times on overcommitted systems.

  * Added peek style API for rte_ring.

  For rings with producer/consumer in RTE_RING_SYNC_ST, RTE_RING_SYNC_MT_HTS
  mode, provide an ability to split enqueue/dequeue operation into two phases
  (enqueue/dequeue start; enqueue/dequeue finish). That allows user to inspect
  objects in the ring without removing them from it (aka MT safe peek).

* **Added flow aging support.**

  Added flow aging support to detect and report aged-out flows, including:

  * Added new action: ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_AGE`` to set the timeout
    and the application flow context for each flow.
  * Added new event: ``RTE_ETH_EVENT_FLOW_AGED`` for the driver to report
    that there are new aged-out flows.
  * Added new query: ``rte_flow_get_aged_flows`` to get the aged-out flows
    contexts from the port.

* **ethdev: Added a new value to link speed for 200Gbps**

* **Updated Amazon ena driver.**

  Updated ena PMD with new features and improvements, including:

  * Added support for large LLQ (Low-latency queue) headers.
  * Added Tx drops as new extended driver statistic.
  * Added support for accelerated LLQ mode.
  * Handling of the 0 length descriptors on the Rx path.

* **Updated Intel i40e driver.**

  Updated i40e PMD with new features and improvements, including:

  * Enable MAC address as FDIR input set for ipv4-other, ipv4-udp and ipv4-tcp.
  * Added support for RSS using L3/L4 source/destination only.
  * Added support for setting hash function in rte flow.

* **Updated the Intel iavf driver.**

  Update the Intel iavf driver with new features and improvements, including:

  * Added generic filter support.
  * Added advanced iavf with FDIR capability.
  * Added advanced RSS configuration for VFs.

* **Updated the Intel ice driver.**

  Updated the Intel ice driver with new features and improvements, including:

  * Added support for DCF (Device Config Function) feature.
  * Added switch filter support for intel DCF.

* **Updated Marvell OCTEON TX2 ethdev driver.**

  Updated Marvell OCTEON TX2 ethdev driver with traffic manager support with
  below features.

  * Hierarchial Scheduling with DWRR and SP.
  * Single rate - Two color, Two rate - Three color shaping.

* **Updated Mellanox mlx5 driver.**

  Updated Mellanox mlx5 driver with new features and improvements, including:

  * Added support for matching on IPv4 Time To Live and IPv6 Hop Limit.
  * Added support for creating Relaxed Ordering Memory Regions.
  * Added support for configuring Hairpin queue data buffer size.
  * Added support for jumbo frame size (9K MTU) in Multi-Packet RQ mode.
  * Removed flow rules caching for memory saving and compliance with ethdev API.
  * Optimized the memory consumption of flow.
  * Added support for flow aging based on hardware counter.

* **Updated the AESNI MB crypto PMD.**

  * Added support for intel-ipsec-mb version 0.54.
  * Updated the AESNI MB PMD with AES-256 DOCSIS algorithm.
  * Added support for synchronous Crypto burst API.

* **Updated the AESNI GCM crypto PMD.**

  * Added support for intel-ipsec-mb version 0.54.

* **Added a new driver for Intel Foxville I225 devices.**

  Added the new ``igc`` net driver for Intel Foxville I225 devices. See the
  :doc:`../nics/igc` NIC guide for more details on this new driver.

* **Updated Broadcom bnxt driver.**

  Updated Broadcom bnxt driver with new features and improvements, including:

  * Added support for host based flow table management
  * Added flow counters to extended stats
  * Added PCI function stats to extended stats

* **Added handling of mixed crypto algorithms in QAT PMD for GEN2.**

  Enabled handling of mixed algorithms in encrypted digest hash-cipher
  (generation) and cipher-hash (verification) requests in QAT PMD
  when running on GEN2 QAT hardware with particular firmware versions
  (GEN3 support was added in DPDK 20.02).

* **Added plain SHA-1,224,256,384,512 support to QAT PMD.**

  Added support for plain SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 hashes
  to QAT PMD.

* **Added QAT intermediate buffer too small handling in QAT compression PMD.**

  Added a special way of buffer handling when internal QAT intermediate buffer
  is too small for Huffman dynamic compression operation. Instead of falling
  back to fixed compression, the operation is now split into multiple smaller
  dynamic compression requests (possible to execute on QAT) and their results
  are then combined and copied into the output buffer. This is not possible if
  any checksum calculation was requested - in such case the code falls back to
  fixed compression as before.

* **Updated the turbo_sw bbdev PMD.**

  Supported large size code blocks which does not fit in one mbuf segment.

* **Added Intel FPGA_5GNR_FEC bbdev PMD.**

  Added a new ``fpga_5gnr_fec`` bbdev driver for the Intel\ |reg| FPGA PAC
  (Programmable  Acceleration Card) N3000.  See the
  :doc:`../bbdevs/fpga_5gnr_fec` BBDEV guide for more details on this new driver.

* **Updated ipsec-secgw sample application with following features.**

  * Updated ipsec-secgw application to add event based packet processing.
    The worker thread(s) would receive events and submit them back to the
    event device after the processing. This way, multicore scaling and HW
    assisted scheduling is achieved by making use of the event device
    capabilities. The event mode currently supports only inline IPsec
    protocol offload.

  * Updated ipsec-secgw application to support key sizes for AES-192-CBC,
    AES-192-GCM, AES-256-GCM algorithms.

  * Added IPsec inbound load-distribution support for ipsec-secgw application
    using NIC load distribution feature(Flow Director).

* **Added rte_graph library.**

  Graph architecture abstracts the data processing functions as a ``node`` and
  ``links`` them together to create a complex ``graph`` to enable reusable/modular
  data processing functions. The graph library provides API to enable graph
  framework operations such as create, lookup, dump and destroy on graph and node
  operations such as clone, edge update, and edge shrink, etc.
  The API also allows to create the stats cluster to monitor per graph and per node stats.

* **Added rte_node library which consists of a set of packet processing nodes.**

  The rte_node library that consists of nodes used by rte_graph library. Each
  node performs a specific packet processing function based on application
  configuration. The following nodes are added:

  * Null node: Skeleton node that defines the general structure of a node.
  * Ethernet device node: Consists of ethernet Rx/Tx nodes as well as ethernet
    control APIs.
  * IPv4 lookup node: Consists of ipv4 extract and lpm lookup node. Routes can
    be configured by the application through ``rte_node_ip4_route_add`` function.
  * IPv4 rewrite node: Consists of ipv4 and ethernet header rewrite functionality
    that can be configured through ``rte_node_ip4_rewrite_add`` function.
  * Packet drop node: Frees the packets received to their respective mempool.

* **Added new l3fwd-graph sample application.**

  Added an example application ``l3fwd-graph``. It demonstrates the usage of graph
  library and node library for packet processing. In addition to the library usage
  demonstration, this application can use for performance comparison with existing
  ``l3fwd`` (The static code without any nodes) with the modular ``l3fwd-graph``
  approach.
