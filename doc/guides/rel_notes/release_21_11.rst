New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense.
     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs (ordered alphabetically by vendor name)
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs
     * Apps, Examples, Tools (if significant)

Removed Items
-------------

.. This section should contain removed items in this release. Sample format:

   * Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the removed item
     in the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* eal: Removed the deprecated function ``rte_get_master_lcore()``
  and the iterator macro ``RTE_LCORE_FOREACH_SLAVE``.

* eal: The old api arguments that were deprecated for
  blacklist/whitelist are removed. Users must use the new
  block/allow list arguments.

* ethdev: Removed the port mirroring API. A more fine-grain flow API
  action ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_SAMPLE`` should be used instead.
  The structures ``rte_eth_mirror_conf`` and ``rte_eth_vlan_mirror`` and
  the functions ``rte_eth_mirror_rule_set`` and
  ``rte_eth_mirror_rule_reset`` along with the associated macros
  ``ETH_MIRROR_*`` are removed.

* ethdev: Removed ``rte_eth_rx_descriptor_done`` API function and its
  driver callback. It is replaced by the more complete function
  ``rte_eth_rx_descriptor_status``.

* ethdev: Removed deprecated ``shared`` attribute of the
  ``struct rte_flow_action_count``. Shared counters should be managed
  using indirect actions API (``rte_flow_action_handle_create`` etc).

* i40e: Removed i40evf driver.
  iavf already became the default VF driver for i40e devices,
  so there is no need to maintain i40evf.


API Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain API changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the API change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* kvargs: The experimental function ``rte_kvargs_strcmp()`` has been
  removed. Its usages have been replaced by a new function
  ``rte_kvargs_get_with_value()``.

* net: Renamed ``s_addr`` and ``d_addr`` fields of ``rte_ether_hdr`` structure
  to ``src_addr`` and ``dst_addr``, respectively.

* cryptodev: The API rte_cryptodev_pmd_is_valid_dev is modified to
  rte_cryptodev_is_valid_dev as it can be used by the application as
  well as PMD to check whether the device is valid or not.

* cryptodev: The rte_cryptodev_pmd.* files are renamed as cryptodev_pmd.*
  as it is for drivers only and should be private to DPDK, and not
  installed for app use.

* cryptodev: A ``reserved`` byte from structure ``rte_crypto_op`` was
  renamed to ``aux_flags`` to indicate warnings and other information from
  the crypto/security operation. This field will be used to communicate
  events such as soft expiry with IPsec in lookaside mode.


ABI Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain ABI changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the ABI change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* security: ``rte_security_set_pkt_metadata`` and ``rte_security_get_userdata``
  routines used by inline outbound and inline inbound security processing were
  made inline and enhanced to do simple 64-bit set/get for PMDs that do not
  have much processing in PMD specific callbacks but just 64-bit set/get.
  This avoids a per packet function pointer jump overhead for such PMDs.

* security: A new option ``iv_gen_disable`` was added in structure
  ``rte_security_ipsec_sa_options`` to disable IV generation inside PMD,
  so that application can provide its own IV and test known test vectors.

* security: A new option ``tunnel_hdr_verify`` was added in structure
  ``rte_security_ipsec_sa_options`` to indicate whether outer header
  verification need to be done as part of inbound IPsec processing.

* security: A new option ``udp_ports_verify`` was added in structure
  ``rte_security_ipsec_sa_options`` to indicate whether UDP ports
  verification need to be done as part of inbound IPsec processing.

* security: A new structure ``rte_security_ipsec_lifetime`` was added to
  replace ``esn_soft_limit`` in IPsec configuration structure
  ``rte_security_ipsec_xform`` to allow applications to configure SA soft
  and hard expiry limits. Limits can be either in number of packets or bytes.

* security: The new options ``ip_csum_enable`` and ``l4_csum_enable`` were added
  in structure ``rte_security_ipsec_sa_options`` to indicate whether inner
  packet IPv4 header checksum and L4 checksum need to be offloaded to
  security device.

* bbdev: Added capability related to more comprehensive CRC options,
  shifting values of the ``enum rte_bbdev_op_ldpcdec_flag_bitmasks``.
