     =======================================================

* **Added write combining store APIs.**

  Added ``rte_write32_wc`` and ``rte_write32_wc_relaxed`` APIs
  that enable write combining stores (depending on architecture).
  The functions are provided as a generic stubs and
  x86 specific implementation.

* **Added prefetch with intention to write APIs.**

  Added new prefetch function variants e.g. ``rte_prefetch0_write``,
  which allow the programmer to prefetch a cache line and also indicate
  the intention to write.

* **Added the rte_cldemote API.**

  Added a hardware hint CLDEMOTE, which is similar to prefetch in reverse.
  CLDEMOTE moves the cache line to the more remote cache, where it expects
  sharing to be efficient. Moving the cache line to a level more distant from
  the processor helps to accelerate core-to-core communication.
  This API is specific to x86 and implemented as a stub for other
  architectures.

* **Added support for limiting maximum SIMD bitwidth.**

  Added a new EAL config setting ``max_simd_bitwidth`` to limit the vector
  path selection at runtime. This value can be set by apps using the
  ``rte_vect_set_max_simd_bitwidth`` function, or by the user with EAL flag
  ``--force-max-simd-bitwidth``.

* **Updated CRC modules of the net library.**

  * Added runtime selection of the optimal architecture-specific CRC path.
  * Added optimized implementations of CRC32-Ethernet and CRC16-CCITT
    using the AVX512 and VPCLMULQDQ instruction sets.

* **Introduced extended buffer description for receiving.**

  Added the extended Rx buffer description for Rx queue setup routine
  providing the individual settings for each Rx segment with maximal size,
  buffer offset and memory pool to allocate data buffers from.

* **Added the FEC API, for a generic FEC query and config.**

  Added the FEC API which provides functions for query FEC capabilities and
  current FEC mode from device. Also, API for configuring FEC mode is also provided.

* **Added thread safety to rte_flow functions.**

  Added ``RTE_ETH_DEV_FLOW_OPS_THREAD_SAFE`` device flag to indicate
  whether PMD supports thread safe operations. If PMD doesn't set the flag,
  rte_flow API level functions will protect the flow operations with mutex.

* **Added flow-based traffic sampling support.**

  Added new action: ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_SAMPLE`` to duplicate the matching
  packets with specified ratio, and apply with own set of actions with a fate
  action. When the ratio is set to 1 then the packets will be 100% mirrored.

* **Added support of shared action in flow API.**

  Added shared action support to utilize single flow action in multiple flow
  rules. An update of shared action configuration alters the behavior of all
  flow rules using it.

  * Added new action: ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_SHARED`` to use shared action
    as flow action.
  * Added new flow APIs to create/update/destroy/query shared action.

* **Flow rules allowed to use private PMD items / actions.**

  * Flow rule verification was updated to accept private PMD
    items and actions.

* **Added generic API to offload tunneled traffic and restore missed packet.**

  * Added a new hardware independent helper to flow API that
    offloads tunneled traffic and restores missed packets.

* **Updated the ethdev library to support hairpin between two ports.**

  New APIs are introduced to support binding / unbinding 2 ports hairpin.
  Hairpin Tx part flow rules can be inserted explicitly.

  For VxLAN packets, added inner UDP/IPv4 support.
  For non-VxLAN packets, added UDP/IPv4 support.

* **Extended flow-perf application.**

  * Started supporting user order instead of bit mask:
    Now the user can create any structure of rte_flow
    using flow performance application with any order,
    moreover the app also now starts to support inner
    items matching as well.
  * Added header modify actions.
  * Added flag action.
  * Added raw encap/decap actions.
  * Added VXLAN encap/decap actions.
  * Added ICMP(code/type/identifier/sequence number) and ICMP6(code/type) matching items.
  * Added option to set port mask for insertion/deletion:
    ``--portmask=N``
    where N represents the hexadecimal bitmask of ports used.

* **Added raw data-path APIs for cryptodev library.**

  Cryptodev is added with raw data-path APIs to accelerate external
  libraries or applications which need to avail fast cryptodev
  enqueue/dequeue operations but does not necessarily depends on
  mbufs and cryptodev operation mempools.

    For more information, see https://01.org/blogs/2019/introducing-intel-data-streaming-accelerator
  * Added support for the fill operation via the API ``rte_ioat_enqueue_fill()``,
    where the hardware fills an area of memory with a repeating pattern.
  * Added a per-device configuration flag to disable management
    of user-provided completion handles.
  * Renamed the ``rte_ioat_do_copies()`` API to ``rte_ioat_perform_ops()``,
    and renamed the ``rte_ioat_completed_copies()`` API to ``rte_ioat_completed_ops()``

    they are limited to copy operations only.
    [Note: The old API is still provided but marked as deprecated in the code]
  * Added a new API ``rte_ioat_fence()`` to add a fence between operations.
    This API replaces the ``fence`` flag parameter in the ``rte_ioat_enqueue_copies()`` function,
    and is clearer as there is no ambiguity as to whether the flag should be
    set on the last operation before the fence or the first operation after it.

* **Updated the pipeline library for alignment with the P4 language.**

  The information provided by these macros is available through standard
  compiler macros.

* eal: Replaced the function ``rte_get_master_lcore()`` to
  ``rte_get_main_lcore()``. The old function is deprecated.

  The iterator for worker lcores is also changed:

  while the aliased flag ``MEMPOOL_F_NO_IOVA_CONTIG`` is kept.

* mbuf: Removed the functions ``rte_mbuf_data_dma_addr*``
  and the macros ``rte_pktmbuf_mtophys*``.
  The same functionality is still available with the functions and macros
  having ``iova`` in their names instead of ``dma_addr`` or ``mtophys``.

* mbuf: Removed the unioned field ``buf_physaddr`` from ``rte_mbuf``.
  The field ``buf_iova`` is remaining from the old union.

* mbuf: Removed the unioned field ``refcnt_atomic`` from
  the structures ``rte_mbuf`` and ``rte_mbuf_ext_shared_info``.

* pci: Removed the ``rte_kernel_driver`` enum defined in rte_dev.h and
  replaced with a private enum in the PCI subsystem.

* pci: Removed the PCI resources map API from the public API
  (``pci_map_resource`` and ``pci_unmap_resource``) and moved it to the
  PCI bus driver along with the PCI resources lists and associated structures
  (``pci_map``, ``pci_msix_table``, ``mapped_pci_resource`` and
  ``mapped_pci_res_list``).

* ethdev: Removed the ``kdrv`` field in the ethdev ``rte_eth_dev_data``
  structure as it gave no useful abstracted information to the applications.

* ethdev: ``rte_eth_rx_descriptor_done()`` API has been deprecated.

* ethdev: Renamed basic statistics per queue. An underscore is inserted
  between the queue number and the rest of the xstat name:

* ethdev: Renamed internal functions:

  * ``_rte_eth_dev_callback_process()`` -> ``rte_eth_dev_callback_process()``
  * ``_rte_eth_dev_reset`` -> ``rte_eth_dev_internal_reset()``

* ethdev: Modified field type of ``base`` and ``nb_queue`` in struct
  ``rte_eth_dcb_tc_queue_mapping`` from ``uint8_t`` to ``uint16_t``.
  As the data of ``uint8_t`` will be truncated when queue number under
  a TC is greater than 256.

* vhost: Moved vDPA APIs from experimental to stable.

* vhost: Add a new function ``rte_vhost_crypto_driver_start`` to be called
  instead of ``rte_vhost_driver_start`` by crypto applications.

* cryptodev: The structure ``rte_crypto_sym_vec`` is updated to support both
  cpu_crypto synchrounous operation and asynchronous raw data-path APIs.

* cryptodev: ``RTE_CRYPTO_AEAD_LIST_END`` from ``enum rte_crypto_aead_algorithm``,
  ``RTE_CRYPTO_CIPHER_LIST_END`` from ``enum rte_crypto_cipher_algorithm`` and
  ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_LIST_END`` from ``enum rte_crypto_auth_algorithm``
  are removed to avoid future ABI breakage while adding new algorithms.

* scheduler: Renamed functions ``rte_cryptodev_scheduler_slave_attach``,
  ``rte_cryptodev_scheduler_slave_detach`` and
  ``rte_cryptodev_scheduler_slaves_get`` to
  ``rte_cryptodev_scheduler_worker_attach``,
  ``rte_cryptodev_scheduler_worker_detach`` and
  ``rte_cryptodev_scheduler_workers_get`` accordingly.

* scheduler: Renamed the configuration value
  ``RTE_CRYPTODEV_SCHEDULER_MAX_NB_SLAVES`` to
  ``RTE_CRYPTODEV_SCHEDULER_MAX_NB_WORKERS``.

* security: ``hfn_ovrd`` field in ``rte_security_pdcp_xform`` is changed from
  ``uint32_t`` to ``uint8_t`` so that a new field ``sdap_enabled`` can be added
  to support SDAP.

* security: The API ``rte_security_session_create`` is updated to take two
  mempool objects one for session and other for session private data.
  So the application need to create two mempools and get the size of session
  private data using API ``rte_security_session_get_size`` for private session
  mempool.

* ipsec: ``RTE_SATP_LOG2_NUM`` has been dropped from ``enum`` and
  subsequently moved ``rte_ipsec`` lib from experimental to stable.

* baseband/fpga_lte_fec: Renamed function ``fpga_lte_fec_configure`` to
  ``rte_fpga_lte_fec_configure`` and structure ``fpga_lte_fec_conf`` to
  ``rte_fpga_lte_fec_conf``.

* baseband/fpga_5gnr_fec: Renamed function ``fpga_5gnr_fec_configure`` to
  ``rte_fpga_5gnr_fec_configure`` and structure ``fpga_5gnr_fec_conf`` to
  ``rte_fpga_5gnr_fec_conf``.

* rawdev: Added a structure size parameter to the functions
  ``rte_rawdev_queue_setup()``, ``rte_rawdev_queue_conf_get()``,
  ``rte_rawdev_info_get()`` and ``rte_rawdev_configure()``,
  allowing limited driver type-checking and ABI compatibility.

* rawdev: Changed the return type of the function ``rte_dev_info_get()``
  and the function ``rte_rawdev_queue_conf_get()``
  from ``void`` to ``int`` allowing the return of error codes from drivers.

* rawdev: The running of a drivers ``selftest()`` function can now be done
  using the ``rawdev_autotest`` command in the ``dpdk-test`` binary. This
  command now calls the self-test function for each rawdev found on the
  system, and does not require a specific command per device type.
  Following this change, the ``ioat_rawdev_autotest`` command has been
  removed as no longer needed.

* raw/ioat: As noted above, the ``rte_ioat_do_copies()`` and
  ``rte_ioat_completed_copies()`` functions have been renamed to
  ``rte_ioat_perform_ops()`` and ``rte_ioat_completed_ops()`` respectively.

* stack: the experimental tag has been dropped from the stack library, and its
  interfaces are considered stable as of DPDK 20.11.

* bpf: ``RTE_BPF_XTYPE_NUM`` has been dropped from ``rte_bpf_xtype``.

* acl: ``RTE_ACL_CLASSIFY_NUM`` enum value has been removed.
  This enum value was not used inside DPDK, while it prevented to add new
  classify algorithms without causing an ABI breakage.

* sched: Added ``subport_profile_id`` as argument
  to function ``rte_sched_subport_config``.

* sched: Removed ``tb_rate``, ``tc_rate``, ``tc_period`` and ``tb_size``
  from ``struct rte_sched_subport_params``.
